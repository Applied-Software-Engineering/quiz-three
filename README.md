# Quiz Three


### Preamble

Software engineering practice does not lend itself to multiple-choice tests that can be automatically marked. 
Rather, each quiz question has a short answer (usually a few words or a single sentence).

These quizzes have been designed to allow readers to test their recall of what has been covered in a session. 
The answers to all the questions can be found in the course text with no need to recourse to "Google".
We recommend that students complete the quizzes after the material in a session has been covered. 


This quiz should take roughly **30 minutes** to complete.
